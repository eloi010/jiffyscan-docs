### Candide Wallet Spearheading Self-Custody of Assets

>*If you don’t self-custody an asset, you don’t really own it*.

The sad reality is that service through which you store your assets is usually a business, and businesses can go, well, out of business. We’ve seen this largest of the banks in the last two decades, most trust-worthy companies, and by highly qualified individuals. It can happen by no one’s ill intention or a company side-stepping certain security measures for growth and then having their customers pay the price later.

Self-Custody ensures no one can play around with your funds and you have complete control over the asset at all times unless you explicitly granted it to a third party.

### 4337 Smart Contracts

A team within [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) launched [a standard](https://docs.jiffyscan.xyz/background/eip-4337) to provide better security with a user experience simple enough to onboard the masses. It is documented as a [proposal with ID 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) and has been infamously called [account abstraction](https://docs.jiffyscan.xyz/background/Account-Abstraction).

It dreams of many abstract features, which [Candide Wallet](https://docs.jiffyscan.xyz/background/Account-Abstraction) has brought to reality for the community.

### Stable Coin for Gas Fee

The fee paid to cause any change on the blockchain is a token specific to each chain (Eth, OETH, bitcoin, etc). More often than not, these are volatile currency and is an overhead for the common folks to own and maintain.

Candide Wallet makes this easier by allowing the user to store only stable a coin (USDC, USDT, DAI, etc) or any ERC-20s tokens and use that to pay the gas fee. Candide Wallet will automatically convert it to the appropriate token of the underlying blockchain network and pay the fee.

### Gasless Transactions

On top of the end-user paying for the gas fee using Stable Coins, Candide supports any application that wants to sponsor the gas fee for its users, simplifying their experience even further.

### Bundled Transactions

Candide wallet automatically merges multiple transactions you need to interact with a Dapp (like allowing transfer for an ERC20 and the actual transfer) into a single action from the end-user, reducing the number of clicks the end-user has to go through as well as significantly reducing the wait-time for the complete set of transactions to finish.

### Heightened Security

Candide Wallet supports [Social Recovery by leveraging your contacts or even for single users](https://docs.candidewallet.com/blog/making-accounts-recoverable), thus avoiding the cumbersome process of maintaining your seed phrases.

It also simulates a transaction before actually submitting it and you can preview and confirm the impact, before actually going ahead with the transaction.

### And more…

They are working on providing session keys to their users, to provide an even better experience, have their own [super-fast bundler in Python](https://docs.candidewallet.com/bundler/intro/), and a very supportive community helping them come up with more relevant offerings continuously.

The Candide Team is having one of the best 4337 wallets and shipping very quickly,  and we highly suggest you take it for a spin if you haven’t yet.
